Adds a bunch of doors to Minecraft

***Requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).***

### Golden Door
This door can be opened and closed by hand, but is locked in its state (can't be opened or closed) when given a redstone signal!
### Bamboo Door
This door can ONLY be opened by hand and does not respond to redstone signals.
### Glass Door
This door can be opened by hand. However, upon being powered by a redstone signal, the state of the door will toggle, i.e. if it is closed it will open, and if it is open it will close.
### Purpur Door
This door, when interacted with, will teleport the player to the opposite side of the door if the door is closed. If it is open, the door will simply close. If the door is interacted with off-axis, then it will not respond. If the teleport is unsafe, then the door will open instead. Redstone works with this door as standard.
### Trapdoors
The mod also adds trapdoors for all of the above. They function in exactly the same way as the doors.
### Other
The mod also adds glass pane versions of all the wooden doors, the iron door and the golden door. These behave the same as their non-glass counter-parts, just look different.
