Adds a bunch of doors to Minecraft

***Requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).***

### Golden Door
This door can be opened and closed by hand, but is locked in its state (can't be opened or closed) when given a redstone signal!
### Bamboo Door
This door can ONLY be opened by hand and does not respond to redstone signals.
### Glass Door
This door can be opened by hand. However, upon being powered by a redstone signal, the state of the door will toggle, i.e. if it is closed it will open, and if it is open it will close.
### Trapdoors
The mod also adds trapdoors for all of the above. They function in exactly the same way as the doors.
### Other
The mod also adds glass pane versions of all the wooden doors, the iron door and the golden door. These behave the same as their non-glass counter-parts, just look different.
